-- >>> MIGRATION 0022 — ADMIN CATALOGUE EXPORT: FULL RULE FAMILIES =============
--
-- v_admin_card_catalogue_export (0010_functions_and_views.sql) already
-- returned reward_rules/cap_rules/milestone_rules/fee_waiver_rules/
-- card_benefits/forex/fuel — everything AD-1's tabbed rule-family editor
-- needs except billing_cycle_rules and redemption_options, the two
-- families catalogue_screen.dart's own doc-comment flagged as missing a
-- tab for. Adding them here rather than a fresh view keeps one single
-- console read for the whole card-detail editor, same shape as before.
